# Astar_Dijkstras
Author: Jing Li
Topic: Compare A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm in sovling path-finding problems in grid map.
Note: use binary heap when implement the two algorithm.
Steps: 1. bulid PriortyQueue, Graph, Network.
       2. build function to implement A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm.
       3. build function to generate grid map according to different problems.
       4. Plot results.
